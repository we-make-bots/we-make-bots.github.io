          <p>
            We get the ideas from our clients for the bots that they want us to make. Note you have to send a form response in order
            to tell us about your idea. This includes <b>all features</b> you want your bot to have and any specific details you want us to
            know about.

          <h2>
            WORK
          </h2>
          <p>
            We then, put on our thinking caps and start working on the ideas. Just know that we are very experienced guys and will
            get your bot idea made. We might contact you while working, to check with any details about your bot. This time depends
            on the bot you want and the deadline you have given.
          </p>

          <h2>
            DELIVER
          </h2>
          <p>
            We then go through a thorough testing process for any bugs and finally deliver the bot to the client and recieve the
            payments. You are informed about the prices at the start of the project. We share the code of the bot and try to make
            our code user friendly, so that you can change / update it.
